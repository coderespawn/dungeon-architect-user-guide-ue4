<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Dungeon Architect is a plugin for Unreal Engine 4 Editor that helps in streamlining the level creation process. It allows you to quickly create levels procedurally (or manually) by blocking out volumes and having the plugin build the environment automatically around it.</p>
<p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4aNgzmibRIs?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>This document introduces you to the various features of Dungeon Architect and guides you through the creation of a simple level</p>
<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>
<p><strong>Marketplace Installation:</strong> Install the plugin from the marketplace using the launcher as usual</p>
<p><strong>Manual Installation:</strong> If you have purchased your copy of Dungeon Architect from Code Respawn, you can download the latest build at any time and install it into your project with the following steps</p>
<ul>
<li>In your game’s root directory, create a folder named Plugins</li>
<li>Copy the DungeonArchitect folder found in this archive under Plugin/4.X/ into your game’s plugin folder (which was created in step 1). For example, in the ShooterGame sample demo, the directory structure should look like this: <img src="../assets/images/install_step1.png" alt="Install Step 1" /></li>
<li>Restart the Unreal Editor (if already open) and verify that Dungeon Architect is enabled by navigating to Window Menu &gt; Plugins. <img src="../assets/images/install_step2.png" alt="Install Step 2" /></li>
<li>Confirm that Dungeon Architect is visible and enabled <img src="../assets/images/install_step3.png" alt="Install Step 3" /></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="generation-overview">Generation Overview</h1>
<p>A dungeon is generated in two phases</p>
<ul>
<li>Layout Generation</li>
<li>Visual Generation</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/da_design.png" alt="Architecture" />
<p class="caption">Architecture</p>
</div>
<h2 id="layout-generation">Layout Generation</h2>
<p>In this phase, only the layout of the dungeon is generated in memory. No meshes or actors are actually spawned.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/layout_2d.jpg" alt="Layout of the dungeon in memory" />
<p class="caption">Layout of the dungeon in memory</p>
</div>
<p>Next, the level is populated with invisible points called <strong>Markers</strong> around the generated layout. A <strong>marker</strong> has only a name and a transformation in the 3D space.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/marker_system_01.png" alt="Markers populated for a sample room" />
<p class="caption">Markers populated for a sample room</p>
</div>
<p>In the above image, after the layout has been built, the dungeon builder has populated the level with marker points around the layout of the dungeon</p>
<h2 id="visual-generation">Visual Generation</h2>
<p>This phase spawns the actors in your scene. It takes all the marker points inserted in the previous phase and replaces them with actors (meshes, lights, blueprints etc) that you have mapped in your theme files</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/marker_system_02.png" alt="Actors spawned by a theme mapping" />
<p class="caption">Actors spawned by a theme mapping</p>
</div>
<p>The theming engine is executed for each marker inserted in the Layout generation phase. In the above example, when a <code>Ground</code> marker is encountered, it would look for a <code>Ground</code> marker mapping in your theme file and replace the marker with the meshes you have mapped to it</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/sample_dungeon.jpg" alt="Result after theme mapping" />
<p class="caption">Result after theme mapping</p>
</div>
<p>The advantage of this data driven theme based approach is that theme files can be swapped to give your dungeon a completly different look. Theme files can also be shared across mulitple projects / teams</p>
<p>Multiple themes can also be used within the same dungeon to create variations</p>
<h1 id="dungeon-actor">Dungeon Actor</h1>
<p>A dungeon actor is used to build your dungeons. Drop a dungeon actor into the scene and reset its transform</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/dugeon_actor_01.png" alt="Dungeon Actors" />
<p class="caption">Dungeon Actors</p>
</div>
<p>The dungeon actor generate a procedural layout for your dungeon based on the various configuration paramters.<br />
After the layout has been generated, it spawns meshes, lights, blueprints etc, based on the mappings you have defined in the Theme file. This way you can define what meshes needs to be attached to the floors, walls, ceilings, etc</p>
<h2 id="properties">Properties</h2>
<p>The Dungeon actor lets you perform various actions on your procedural dungeon. Select the Dungeon Actor and have a look at the Dungeon category under the details window</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/dungeon_actor_actions_v2.png" alt="Dungeon Actor Properties" />
<p class="caption">Dungeon Actor Properties</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Build Dungeon:</strong> Builds a procedural dungeon. You need to define atleast one theme before you build</p>
<p><strong>Destroy Dungeon:</strong> Destroys an existing dungeon owned by this actor. If you want to rebuild a dungeon after modifying the theme, there is no need to destroy first and you can directly click build</p>
<p><strong>Randomize Seed:</strong> A convenience function that changes the seed in the configuration. Changing the seed would completly change the layout of your dungeon</p>
<p><strong>Builder Class:</strong> A builder is responsible for creating the layout of your dungeon. It contains the method and techniques to design your dungeon. There are different types of builders available</p>
<ul>
<li>Grid: Create complex dungeons with this builder. It supports height variations, stairs, rooms and corridors</li>
<li>FloorPlan: Creates floor plans for your building interiors</li>
<li>Isaac: Creates dungeon layout similar to the game Binding of Isaac. It also supports decorators to further beautify the layout</li>
<li>Snap: Create your modules (rooms) in separate levels and this builder generates a dungeon with these modules by stitching them together</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Config:</strong> The configuration category changes based on the structure your select. Hover your mouse pointer over the various fields for more info</p>
<p><strong>Themes:</strong> A theme file lets you design the look and feel of your dungeon. There’s an interactive editor that lets you design your own themes. You need to specify atleast one theme file before you can build your dungeon (quick start guide comes with many pre-created themes to get you started)</p>
<p><strong>Marker Emitters:</strong> Dungeon Architect is designed to be modular and it contains many extension points so you can plugin in your own functionality using Blueprints or C++. Marker Emitters is one such extension point that lets you insert marker points in the scene, which your theme can later pick up replace with actors (like meshes, lights etc)</p>
<h1 id="dungeon-builders">Dungeon Builders</h1>
<p>A Dungeon Builder generates the layout of your dungeon. It contains the method and techniques to design your dungeon. There are multiple builders available and you can also create your own implementation if you wish (in blueprint or C++). This allows Dungeon Architect to be extensible and not restricted to a single dungeon layout technique</p>

<p>Here we explore the various dungeon builders that ship with Dungeon Architect</p>
<h2 id="grid-builder">Grid Builder</h2>
<p>This builder creates complex and beautiful dungeons with rooms, cooridors and height variations.</p>

<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>Select the Dungeon Actor from the Details window</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/dungeon_config_grid.png" alt="Dungeon Config Parameters" />
<p class="caption">Dungeon Config Parameters</p>
</div>
<p>The various config parameters determine how the layout of the dungeon is generated procedurally. The default layout generator algorithm is implemented based on the excellent <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/">writeup</a> by TinyKeep’s author Phi Dinh</p>
<p>The various parameters are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seed</strong>: Changing this number would completely change the layout of the dungeon. This is the base random number seed that is used to build the dungeon</li>
<li><strong>Num Cells</strong>: The number of cells to use while building the dungeon. You will not see these cells in the final result. A larger number would create a bigger and more complex dungeon. A number of 100-150 builds a medium to large sized dungeon. Experiment with different ranges</li>
<li><strong>Min/Max Cell Size</strong>: This is how big or small a cell size can be. While generation, a cell is either converted to a room, corridor or is discarded completely. The Cell width / height is randomly chosen within this range</li>
<li><strong>Room Area Threshold</strong>: If a cell size exceeds past this limit, it is converted into a room. After cells are promoted to rooms, all rooms are connected to each other through corridors (either directly or indirectly. See spanning tree later)</li>
<li><strong>Room Aspect Delta</strong>: The aspect ratio of the cells (width to height ratio). Keeping this value near 0 would create square rooms. Bringing this close to 1 would create elongated / stretched rooms with a high width to height ratio</li>
<li><strong>Spanning Tree Loop</strong>: Determines how many loops you would like to have in your dungeon. A value near 0 will create fewer loops creating linear dungeons. A value near 1 would create lots of loops, which would look unoriginal. Its good to allow a few loops so a value close to zero (like 0.2 should be good)</li>
<li><strong>Stair Connection Tolerance</strong>: The generator would add stairs to make different areas of the dungeon accessible. However, we do not want too many stairs. For e.g., before adding a stair in a particular elevated area, the generator would check if this area is already accessible from a nearby stair. If so, it would not add it. This tolerance parameter determines how far to look for an existing path before we can add a stair. Play with this parameter if you see too many stairs close to each other, or too few</li>
<li><strong>Height Variation Probability</strong>: Tweak this value to increase / reduce the height variations (and stairs) in your dungeon. A value close to 0 reduces the height variation and increases as you approach 1. Increasing this value to a higher level might create dungeons with no place for proper stair placement since there is too much height variation. A value of 0.2 to 0.4 seems good</li>
<li><strong>Normal Mean / Std</strong>: The random number generator used in the dungeon generator does not use a uniform distribution. Instead it uses a normal distribution to get higher frequency of lower values and fewer higher values (and hence fewer room cells and a lot more corridor cells). Play with these parameters for different results</li>
<li><strong>Grid Cell Size</strong>: The dungeon generator works on a grid based system and required modular mesh assets to be placed on each cell (floors, walls, doors etc). This important field specifies the size of the cell to use. This size is determined by the art asset used in the dungeon theme designed by the artist. In the demo, we have a floor mesh that is 400x400. The height of a floor is chosen to be 200 units as the stair mesh is 200 units high. Hence the defaults are set to 400x400x200. You should change this to the dimension of the modular asset your designer has created for the dungeon</li>
<li><strong>Max Allowed Stair Height</strong>: The number of logical floor units the dungeon height can vary. This determines how high the dungeon’s height can vary (e.g. max 2 floors high). Set this value depending on the stair meshes you designer has created. In the sample demo, there are two stair meshes, one 200 units high (1 floor) and another 400 units high (2 floors). So the default is set to 2</li>
<li><strong>Initial Room Radius</strong>: Internal Usage. Keep to a low value like 10-15</li>
<li><strong>Floor Height</strong>: Internal Usage. Ignored for now</li>
<li><strong>Instanced</strong>: Use mesh instancing for lower batch count</li>
<li><strong>Max Build Time Per Frame</strong>: The dungeon can be built over multiple frames so as to not hang the game (or the editor UI) while it is being built. This value determines how much time is spent on each frame to build the dungeon. Setting it to 0 would build the entire dungeon synchronously in a single frame. Settting to 33ms for eg, would build it over multiple frames. You get a callback notification when the dungeon build is complete</li>
</ul>

</div>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Seed</strong>: Changing this number would completely change the layout of the dungeon. This is the base random number seed that is used to build the dungeon</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Building Size</strong>: This is the building size in logical “Grid” units. (see grid size below). Adjust this to change the size of your floor</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Grid Size</strong>: The size of a tile in the floor map. The floor map is created in a tiled grid. Adjust the size here based on your art assets defined in the theme file</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Min/Max Size</strong>: The minimum / maximum size of the room, in logical grid cooridnates</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Hall Width</strong>: Every room is directly or indirectly connected to a hallway. This parameter controls the size of the hallway in grid coordinate</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Min Room Chunk Area</strong>: Rooms are groups together with other rooms. However, they may be split with a hallway in between them if the combined area is greater than this value</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instanced</strong>: Use mesh instancing for lower batch count</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max Build Time Per Frame</strong>: The dungeon can be built over multiple frames so as to not hang the game (or the editor UI) while it is being built. This value determines how much time is spent on each frame to build the dungeon. Setting it to 0 would build the entire dungeon synchronously in a single frame.

<h2 id="snap-builder">Snap Builder</h2>
<p>Create your modules in separate levels. Then have DA create a dungeon with those modules by stiching them together</p>
<p><iframe width="853" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g4IXs_ns1NY?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/snap_builder_eg_1.jpg" alt="Floor Plan Builder" /> <img src="../assets/images/snap_builder_eg_2.jpg" alt="Floor Plan Builder" /></p>
<p>The designer would create a module (e.g. a room) in separate levels and assign attachment points (so other modules can connect to it). These attachment points are called SnapDoors. DA would them stitch them together</p>
<p>With this builder, the artist gets a lot more control on how each module looks. Here are some sample modules, each in its own individual level</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/snap_module_1.png" alt="Floor Plan Builder" /> <img src="../assets/images/snap_module_2.png" alt="Floor Plan Builder" /> <img src="../assets/images/snap_module_3.png" alt="Floor Plan Builder" /></p>
<p>After you have designed a module, drop in the SnapDoor asset where an exit / entrance is expected so other modules can attach to it. Adjust the rotation so the red arrow is aligned with the door exit <img src="../assets/images/snap_module_drop_door.jpg" alt="Add a door to the module" /></p>
<p>Door snap assets can be created like so: <img src="../assets/images/snap_create_door.png" alt="Create a Snap Door Asset" /></p>
<p>A Snap Door has its own editor where you define how the door would look <img src="../assets/images/snap_door_editor.png" alt="Snap Door Editor" /></p>
<p>Sometimes the door might not be connected to another module. In this case, it’s preferable to block the wall off instead of leaving an open space. You can specify that mesh by switching the tab <img src="../assets/images/snap_door_editor_tab.png" alt="Snap Door Editor" /></p>
<p>Switch to your game level and register all these modules in your dungeon actor and build <img src="../assets/images/snap_module_register.png" alt="Register Snap Modules" /></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Seed</strong>: Changing this number would completely change the layout of the dungeon. This is the base random number seed that is used to build the dungeon</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Modules</strong>: Here is where you register your module level assets. DA would use these modules as building blocks to build your dungeon</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Ignored Module Actor Type</strong>: Since modules are designed in individual level files, there might be actors in the module level which we don’t want to be a part of the module itself (e.g. skybox, directional light, skylight, etc). While spawning a module, DA would ignore actors of the specified types</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max Modules</strong>: The no. of modules to spawn in the dungeon. The higher the number, the bigger the dungeon</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collision Test Contraction</strong>: When the modules are stitched together, DA makes sure that the newly spawned module would not overlap with any of the existing spawned module. Setting this value to 0 would not spawn a module in locations with even the slightest overlap. Setting to 100 units for e.g., would tolerate an overlap of 100 Unreal units</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max Depth</strong>: Determines how deep a chain of modules extend before they are branched out. Set to 0 to ignore this field. Setting to say 10, would stitch modules linearly 10 levels deep, before it branches of into another direction from an earlier module (if it has more than 2 doors)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Instanced</strong>: Use mesh instancing for lower batch count</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Max Build Time Per Frame</strong>: The dungeon can be built over multiple frames so as to not hang the game (or the editor UI) while it is being built. This value determines how much time is spent on each frame to build the dungeon. Setting it to 0 would build the entire dungeon synchronously in a single frame. Settting to 33ms for eg, would build it over multiple frames. You get a callback notification when the dungeon build is complete</p></li>

<h2 id="marker-nodes">Marker Nodes</h2>
<p>After the layout generation phase, the scene would be scattered with invisible named points called <strong>Markers</strong>. Then, for every marker point in the scene, the theming engine looks for a corresponding <strong>Marker Node</strong> with that marker name. If found, it would start executing all the nodes defined below the marker node.</p>
<p>For e.g., if you have a marker node named <code>Ground</code>, it would be invoked for every <code>Ground</code> marker found in the scene. Once invoked, the theming engine executes all the nodes defined below it from left to right untill a certain condition is met</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/marker_nodes_01.png" alt="Ground Marker Node" />
<p class="caption">Ground Marker Node</p>
</div>
<p>In the above example:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the first phase, the layout builder has populated the map with ground markers, wherever a ground mesh was expected.<br />
</li>
<li>Then in the next phase, the theming engine ecounters the <code>Ground</code> marker while iterating through all the markers in the scene</li>
<li>It then looks for a <strong>Marker Node</strong> named <code>Ground</code> in the theme graph</li>
<li>Once found, it executes the visual nodes defined below it, starting from left to right</li>
</ol>
<p>When you create a new theme asset, the theme graph comes with a set of default marker nodes.</p>
<p>You can define new marker nodes and build your own hierarcy for advanced theming</p>
<p>Names of custom marker nodes can be changed by double clicking on them, or from the details tab</p>
<h3 id="creating-marker-nodes">Creating marker nodes</h3>
<p>There are several ways to create a new marker node:</p>
<p>Right click anywhere in the empty area and expand the <code>Dungeon</code> category and click <strong>Add Marker Node</strong> <img src="../assets/images/marker_create_01.png" alt="Add new marker node from Context Menu" /></p>
<p>Alternatively, these context menu actions are also visible in the Actions tab. Drag and drop the <strong>Add Marker Node</strong> action into any empty area in the graph <img src="../assets/images/marker_create_02.png" alt="Add new marker node from Actions Tab" /></p>
<h2 id="visual-nodes">Visual Nodes</h2>
<p>Visual nodes are used for spawning actors into the scene (e.g. meshes, lights, particle systems, blueprints etc). They are usually attached to a marker node and executed whenever an marker with that name is encountered in the scene. When executed, it spawns an actor defined within it and places it in the scene where the marker was encountered</p>
<p>You can create the following visual nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mesh Node</strong> - Good for spawning static meshes.</li>
<li><strong>Point Light Node</strong> - Spawns point lights anywhere in your dungeon</li>
<li><strong>Spot Light Node</strong> - Spawns spot lights</li>
<li><strong>Particle Node</strong> - Spawns particle systems</li>
<li><strong>Actor Node</strong> - Spawn any type of actor by specifying it’s class</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have the Dungeon Architect Paper2D extension installed, then you can spawn additional visual nodes</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Paper Sprite Node</strong> - Good for spawning individual sprites</li>
<li><strong>Paper Flipbook Node</strong> - Spawn animated sprites</li>
<li><strong>Paper Tile Node</strong> - Spawn tiles extracted from a Paper2D tilemap. The editor gives you a user-friendly UI to select the tile from the tilemap</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="creating-visual-nodes">Creating visual nodes</h3>
<p>There are several ways to create a new visual node:</p>

<h2 id="marker-emitter-nodes">Marker Emitter Nodes</h2>
<p>Marker Emitters emit new markers into the scene. These nodes are attached to visual nodes and if the parent visual node is executed, it would insert a named marker into the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Marker Emitter</strong> nodes are similar in apperarance to Marker Nodes. However, they are purple in color and have an input pin, instead of an output pin</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/theme_file_example2.jpg" alt="Sample theme file" />
<p class="caption">Sample theme file</p>
</div>
<p>In the above example, the <code>Wall</code> Marker has 3 Mesh nodes attached to it with probability such that any one for the 3 would be randomly chosen.<br />
One of the 3 meshes has a window in it and we would like to decorate that mesh with curtains, but only if that node is selected. So, we define a new Marker named <code>Window</code> (can be any name) and attach curtain meshes to it. Then we <strong>emit</strong> a Window Marker Node from the desired visual node. Hence, if the mesh in the middle is executed, it would also insert a marker named <em>Window</em> in its position. Then the theming engine would execute everything beneath the <code>Window</code> marker and pick a random curtain and attach to the wall</p>
<p>This ability of defining your own hierarchy lets you design powerful themes for your levels</p>

<h3 id="cycles">Cycles</h3>
<p>Cycles are not allowed when you emit markers as it doesn’t make sense to continuously emit markers in an infinite loop</p>

<h1 id="theme-node-properties">Theme Node Properties</h1>
<p>A node in the theme graph can be customized from the Details Tab</p>
<h2 id="visual-nodes-1">Visual Nodes</h2>
<p>Select a visual node (e.g. a mesh node) and have a look at the details tab:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/mesh_node_properties_a.png" alt="Mesh Node properties" />
<p class="caption">Mesh Node properties</p>
</div>
<p>The properties that are common to all Visual nodes (Mesh, Blueprints, Lights, Particle, Sprite etc) are explained below:</p>
<p><strong>Affinity:</strong> This is the probability of attachment. When this node is executed, the theming engine looks at this variable and rolls a dice and decides whether to insert this visual object into the scene or not. If this value is 1.0, then it would insert it 100% of the time. If the value is 0, then it would not insert it since selection probabiliyt 0%. If it is 0.5, then it would insert it 50% of the time</p>
<p><strong>Consume on Attach:</strong> If the visual object was indeed spawned into the scene (based on the probability above), the theming engine would then look at this flag to decide if we need to execute the next sibling node. If it is checked, then execution stops for this marker. If it is unchecked, the next sibling gets processed. <em>Affinity</em> and <em>Consume on Attach</em> can be combined to create interesting possiblities in your theme</p>
<p><strong>Offset:</strong> Apply transformation offset to your visual object relative to the marker location. This is a very useful property while designing your theme. If the pivot of the mesh your artist has designed isn’t where you wish it were, you can easily adjust it here to translate / rotate it around. You can also scale objects if they are too small / big. While designing your theme, you might be using this useful property to re-position your visual nodes, if required.</p>
<p><strong>Selection Logic:</strong> Lets you define selection logic blueprints. You have seen an example above of node selected based on random probability (Affinity property). The selection process can be far more power than a simple random probability based selection. You can define you own blueprints and assign it here so you blueprint logic could decide if a node is to be selected or not. More details below</p>
<p><strong>Transform Logic:</strong> In the Offset property as seen above, you can define a static offset transformation to move/scale/rotate the visual object from the marker position. With Transform Logic, you can define blueprint based transformation where you can provide dynamic tranform offsets based on a logic. For e.g., you might want to rotate/scale/translate a tree randomly to give natural variation instead of having them all face the same direction. More on this later</p>

<p>Selection rules gives you more power, when you need it. In the rule’s blueprint logic, you can query the dungeon model and determin if this node should be inserted into the scene</p>

<p class="caption">Multiple visual nodes working together</p>

<p>In the above example, the first node has <strong>Consume on Attach</strong> checked. So if your blueprint logic selects the node, the sandstone mesh will be inserted and the execution stops. However if the selection node doesn’t select the node, the execution will always proceed to the next node and execute the mesh which inserts a clay brick mesh</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/selection_rule_eg1_1.jpg" /> In the above example, the selection rule is applied to the golden pillar. But whenever it is selected, it stops execution because the <strong>Consume on Attach</strong> variable is set and doesn’t build a ground mesh there. Unchecking <strong>Consume on Attach</strong> on the first node lets the execution proceed even if it is inserted into the scene <img src="../assets/images/selection_rule_eg1_2.jpg" /></p>

<h1 id="paint-mode">Paint Mode</h1>
<p>Dungeon Architect also allows you to paint your own dungeon layouts with a special editor mode. This gives you more artistic control as you are no longer restricted by what the procedural algorithm creates</p>
<p>To Activate the Paint Editor mode and start painting, Switch to the <em>Dungeon Paint</em> Tab</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/paint_em_01.png" alt="Dungeon Paint Editor Mode" />
<p class="caption">Dungeon Paint Editor Mode</p>

<p>As soon as you switch to the Paint Mode, the viewport shows the layout of your dungeon in Blue</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/paint_01.jpg" /> <img src="../assets/images/paint_02.jpg" alt="Dungeon Paint Editor Mode" /></p>
<p>There are various tools you could use to paint your dungeons</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/paint_tools.png" alt="Paint tools" />
<p class="caption">Paint tools</p>
</div>
<h2 id="paint-tool">Paint Tool</h2>
<p>The paint tool allows you to paint at different heights. Custom painted blocks are Cyan in color</p>
<p>Paint by holding <em>Left click</em></p>
<p>Delete a painted block by <em>Shift + Left Click</em></p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/paint_03.jpg" /> <img src="../assets/images/paint_04.jpg" /></p>
<p>You can adjust the size of the paint brush and change the logical floor height you would like to paint on</p>

<h2 id="border-tool">Border Tool</h2>
<p>The border tool works similar to the Rectangle tool, paints along the border of the rectangle layed down by the user.</p>
<p>Hold and drag to draw a rectangle. Release to commit the changes. Custom painted blocks are Cyan in color</p>
<p>The thickness of the border can be adjusted with the Brush Size property</p>
<p>You can paint in different height by changing the <em>Floor Index</em> property</p>

<h2 id="manual-painting">Manual Painting</h2>
<p>If you do not want any procedural content to be generated when you paint your level, then set the <strong>Num Cells</strong> property to <code>0</code> in your Dungeon Actor’s Configuration section</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/num_cells_0.png" alt="Stop procedural layout generation" />
<p class="caption">Stop procedural layout generation</p>
</div>
<p>This way the dungeon would have an empty layout, allowing you to paint from scratch</p>
<p>If you do want procedural content but want to remove certain procedural areas that are getting in your way, then use a <em>Negation Volume</em></p>
<h1 id="volumes">Volumes</h1>
<p>Dungeon Architect provides various volumes to help you influence your dungeon as per your requirements.</p>
<h2 id="platform-volume">Platform Volume</h2>
<p>Place a platform volume anywhere in the scene and Dungeon Architect would adjust the dungeon layout and create a platform (room or corridor) at that location. Scale the volume along the XY plane to change the size of the generated platform. You can move the platform volume with the move tool to the desired location. (Rotation is not supported)</p>
<p>This gives you artistic control and lets you manipulate the dungeon to suit your needs</p>
<p>Here is an example of a user generated layout using volumes leading up to a boss fight</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/vol_platform_01.jpg" alt="User defined dungeon layout" />
<p class="caption">User defined dungeon layout</p>
</div>
<p>To place a platform volume, go to Volumes tab and drag and drop it into the scene</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/vol_platform_02.jpg" alt="Place a platform volume into the scene" />
<p class="caption">Place a platform volume into the scene</p>
</div>
<p>Select the platform volume and have a look at it’s properties</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/vol_platform_03.jpg" alt="Platform Volume Properties" />
<p class="caption">Platform Volume Properties</p>
</div>
<p>The Volume needs to know which dungeon the volume belongs to (DA Supports mulitple dungeons within the same scene). Select the dungeon you have in your scene.</p>
<p>Relatime Update flag updates the dungeon as you move/scale the platform volume, giving you interactive feedback. Uncheck if you face performance issues (Or, build the dungeon over multiple frames without stalling the UI by setting the Dungeon actor config propery’s field <em>MaxBuildTimePerFrameMs</em> to around 20 to 30)</p>
<p>An example of a corridor segment created using a platform volume. Notice how the platform nicely blends with the existing geometry if it comes in contact with it</p>

<p>Rooms always connect to atleast one other room in the dungeon. Changing the Cell type to <em>Room</em> creates this result</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Room creation using a Platform Volume</p>
</div>
<h2 id="theme-override-volume">Theme Override Volume</h2>
<p>Give certain areas of you dungeons a different look and feel. Layout inside this volume would use the theme defined by this volume.</p>
<p>This is useful for adding variations to your level</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>The <strong>Reversed</strong> flag, if checked, overrides the theme of everything outside of the volume (as opposed to inside)</p>
<p><strong>Realtime Update</strong> updates the dungeon as it is moved or scaled giving your immediate visual feedback</p>
<p>Note: When overriding, the themes needs to be designed for the same grid cell size for proper results</p>
<h2 id="negation-volume">Negation Volume</h2>
<p>This volume removes all procedural geometry inside of this volume. Use this to get rid of procedural geometry in areas you do not need or when it is getting in the way while manually painting your layout</p>

<h2 id="mirror-volume">Mirror Volume</h2>
<p>Mirror Volumes lets you create symmetric dungeon by mirroring the layout of a dungeon</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/vol_mirror_01.jpg" alt="Dungeon Mirrored along the X-axis" />
<p class="caption">Dungeon Mirrored along the X-axis</p>

<p class="caption">Dungeon Mirrored along both the X and Y-axis</p>
</div>
<p>This is useful when you need symmetry in your maps (e.g. strategy games)</p>
<p>To create a Mirror Volume, drag it from the volumes tab:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/vol_mirror_03.jpg" alt="Drag and drop a Mirror volume from the Volumes tab" />
<p class="caption">Drag and drop a Mirror volume from the Volumes tab</p>
</div>
<p>Place the volume where you would like to have the layout mirrored. The mirroring would happen along the local X-axis of the volume. You can rotate the volume in steps of 90 degrees (0, 90, 180, 270) to mirror in different directions</p>
<p>Multiple mirrors can also be placed within the same dungeon</p>

<h1 id="marker-emitters">Marker Emitters</h1>
<p>Marker Emitters are blueprint scripts (or C++) that lets you emit your own markers anywhere in the map</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/da_design_me.png" alt="Architecture" />
<p class="caption">Architecture</p>
</div>
<p>As seen previously, <em>Markers</em> are emitted by the Dungeon Builder class around the layout of the dungeon (e.g. Wall, Ground, Fence etc) and you can insert actors at that location from the Theme graph. You can even create your own markers emitted off of those parent markers, but without <em>Marker Emitters</em> you are restricted to the starting markers the dungeon builder has initially emitted for you</p>
<p>Marker Emitters gives you a lot of flexibility and you can query the dungeon model and emit markers anywhere in the map</p>
<p>A Marker Emitter is invoked right after the Dungeon Builder emits all the markers for the dungeon (Ground, Wall etc)</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-marker-emitter">Creating a Marker Emitter</h2>
<p>Create a new Blueprint class derived from DungeonMarkerEmitter <img src="../assets/images/create_marker_emiter_dialog.png" alt="Create a new marker emitter" /></p>
<p>Assign the created blueprint marker emitter to the Dungeon Actor</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/assign_marker_emitter.png" alt="Assign to the Dungeon actor" />
<p class="caption">Assign to the Dungeon actor</p>
</div>
<p>Start placing your logic in the blueprint by overriding the <strong>Emit Markers</strong> function</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/marker_emitter_04.png" alt="Override the EmitMarkers function" />
<p class="caption">Override the EmitMarkers function</p>
</div>
<p>This method is invoked by the engine and lets you emit as many markers as you like into the scene with any transforms.</p>
<p>To emit a marker, create a <em>Emit Marker</em> node</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="../assets/images/marker_emitter_05.png" alt="Emit Marker Node" />
<p class="caption">Emit Marker Node</p>
</div>
<p>You can emit as many markers as you like</p>
<h2 id="theme-preview">Theme Preview</h2>
<p>If you want to preview your marker emitter logic in the Theme Editor’s 3D Preview viewport, you can set it up like this:</p>
<p>Navigate to the theme editor’s 3D Viewport &gt; Properties &gt; Dungeon</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Theme Editor’s 3D Viewport &gt; Properties &gt; Dungeon</p>
</div>
<p>This will open up the dungeon properties. Add your marker emitter there and the preview viewport will pick up the markers emitted by your Marker Emitter blueprint script and show it in the preview viewport</p>

<h2 id="example-2-2">Example #2</h2>
<p>The <em>Hell Forge</em> demo has a good looking cave like system generated using Marker Emitters.</p>
<p>Since the rocks for the cave walls cannot be inserted in the Wall and Fence markers (as they are big and would block the passage), we need to find positions in the empty space that are further away from the walls and fences</p>
<p>This is done with a marker emitter blueprint <code>DA_InfinityBlade_Fire/Dungeons/Rules/MarkerEmitter/BPM_AdjacentCellEmitter</code></p>
