Theme Node Properties
=====================

A node in the theme graph can be customized from the Details Tab

Visual Nodes
------------
Select a visual node (e.g. a mesh node) and have a look at the details tab:

![Mesh Node properties](../assets/images/mesh_node_properties_a.png)

The properties that are common to all Visual nodes (Mesh, Blueprints, Lights, Particle, Sprite etc) are explained below:

**Affinity:**  This is the probability of attachment.  When this node is executed, the theming engine looks at this variable and rolls a dice and decides whether to insert this visual object into the scene or not.  If this value is 1.0, then it would insert it 100% of the time.  If the value is 0, then it would not insert it since selection probabiliyt 0%.  If it is 0.5, then it would insert it 50% of the time

**Consume on Attach:** If the visual object was indeed spawned into the scene (based on the probability above), the theming engine would then look at this flag to decide if we need to execute the next sibling node.  If it is checked, then execution stops for this marker.  If it is unchecked, the next sibling gets processed.  *Affinity* and *Consume on Attach* can be combined to create interesting possiblities in your theme

**Offset:** Apply transformation offset to your visual object relative to the marker location.  This is a very useful property while designing your theme.   If the pivot of the mesh your artist has designed isn't where you wish it were, you can easily adjust it here to translate / rotate it around.  You can also scale objects if they are too small / big.  While designing your theme, you might be using this useful property to re-position your visual nodes, if required.

**Selection Logic:** Lets you define selection logic blueprints.  You have seen an example above of node selected based on random probability (Affinity property).   The selection process can be far more power than a simple random probability based selection.  You can define you own blueprints and assign it here so you blueprint logic could decide if a node is to be selected or not.  More details below

**Transform Logic:** In the Offset property as seen above, you can define a static offset transformation to move/scale/rotate the visual object from the marker position.  With Transform Logic, you can define blueprint based transformation where you can provide dynamic tranform offsets based on a logic.  For e.g., you might want to rotate/scale/translate a tree randomly to give natural variation instead of having them all face the same direction.  More on this later

### Mesh Node
A mesh not lets you place static meshes on the scene

![Mesh Node properties](../assets/images/node_prop_mesh.png)

**Mesh:** Specify the static mesh you would like to use here

**Material Overrides**: Optionally override the material of a mesh. Index property lets you set the sub-mesh index.  Multiple material overrides can be assigned

![Mesh Node Advanced properties](../assets/images/node_prop_mesh2.png)

**Advanced properties**: Modify advanced mesh node properties from here.  Note: The *material overrides* and *static mesh* parameter has to be set in the node's property as described above and not here

TIP: Drag a static mesh from the content browser on to the graph window to quickly create a mesh node

### Point Light Node

Place point lights on the scene with this node

![Point Light Node Properties](../assets/images/node_prop_pointlight.png)

Adjust light properties (intensity, shadow, color etc) from the **Point Light** field


### Spot Light Node

Place spot lights on the scene with this node

![Spot Light Node Properties](../assets/images/node_prop_spotlight.png)

Adjust light properties (intensity, shadow, color etc) from the **Point Light** field

Spot lights in the preview window show an arrow indicating the direction the spot light is pointing to

### Particle Node

Place particle emitters on the scene with this node

![Particle Emitter Node Properties](../assets/images/node_prop_particle.jpg)

Assign the Paritcle system template in the **Particle System** field

You can drag and drop a particle system from the content browser on to the theme editor to create a new particle system node

![Particle Node Drag Drop](../assets/images/drag_drop_particle_node.png)


### Actor Class Node

You can place any kind of actor in the scene using an **Actor Node**

![Actor Node Properties](../assets/images/node_prop_actor1.png)

Set the class of the actor you would like to spawn in the **Class Template** field

![Actor Node spawning a Reflection Capture Actor](../assets/images/node_prop_actor2.png)

After you have set a class, you can modify and customize your actor properties.  This allows you to set your actor's public blueprint variables

### Destructible Mesh Node

![Destructible Mesh](../assets/images/destruct_mesh_wall.jpg)

Spawn destructible meshes on your scene using this node.   Destructible meshes are a feature in UE4 that lets you fracture a mesh when it is damaged.   You can find more info on creating destructible meshes [here](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Videos/PLZlv_N0_O1gYeJX3xX44yzOb7_kTS7FPM/-gGiEmYj4oE/)

After you have created a destructible mesh, you can assign it to this node from the details window

![Destructible Mesh Details](../assets/images/destruct_mesh_details.png)

The Deathmatch shooter demo uses destructible meshes. The players can shoot at it and break the walls

Marker Node
-----------

![Marker Node Properties](../assets/images/node_prop_marker.png)

You can change the name of a marker node by setting it's **Marker Name** field


Marker Emitter Node
-------------------

![Marker Emitter Node Properties](../assets/images/node_prop_marker_emitter.png)

When you emit a marker, you can apply an offset to the emitted marker in the **Offset** field
