##Using Multiple Dungeons
You can setup multiple dungeons in your scene.    A dungeon is generated relative to the position of the dungeon actor


##Blend with existing art
Blend procedural dungeons with your existing level art by creating constraints using platform volumes so they make an entrace from your static artist designed levels to your dungeons

After dropping two dungeons actors into the scene, they were forced to connect to these artist generated entrace using a platform volume and marker replacement volume (to force create a door)
