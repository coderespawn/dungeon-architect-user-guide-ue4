Installation
============
**Marketplace Installation:**
Install the plugin from the marketplace using the launcher as usual


**Manual Installation:**
If you have purchased your copy of Dungeon Architect from Code Respawn, you can download the latest build at any time and install it into your project with the following steps

* In your game's root directory, create a folder named Plugins
* Copy the DungeonArchitect folder found in this archive under Plugin/4.X/ into your game's plugin folder (which was created in step 1).  For example, in the ShooterGame sample demo, the directory structure should look like this:
![Install Step 1](../assets/images/install_step1.png)
* Restart the Unreal Editor (if already open) and verify that Dungeon Architect is enabled by navigating to Window Menu > Plugins.  ![Install Step 2](../assets/images/install_step2.png)
* Confirm that Dungeon Architect is visible and enabled
